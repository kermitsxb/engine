# Contribution Guidelines

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

This document proposes guidelines for contributing to the La Tech Force Engine repository.

The objectives of the guidelines are:

- Make sure that contributing is an enjoyable experience, and that contributors are respected. (e.g. avoid endless discussions and flame wars)
- Make sure that the quality of the codebase increases over time. (or at least remains stable)
- Make sure that contributions solve more problems than they create. (e.g. a "fix" that was not tested properly will cause long discussions)
- Make sure to not wasting other contributors' time.

These are just guidelines, not rules, use your best judgment and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## What to contribute

You can contribute to La Tech Force Engine in various ways:

- Fix bugs or contribute to the development of features on which help is wanted: [see our To Do list](https://github.com/orgs/latechforce/projects/1)
- Submit Github issues for bugs you (or other users) found ([template](https://github.com/latechforce/engine/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=))
- Give feedback, suggest feature and/or provide value in ongoing discussions in [issues](https://github.com/latechforce/engine/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/latechforce/engine/pulls)

> **Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github). And don't hesitate to ask for assistance by posting a message in any of the Github issues that you would like to contribute to.

## How to contribute to the code base

1. Fork and clone the [@latechforce\_/engine repository](https://github.com/latechforce/engine), and make sure it runs properly on your computer
2. Inform other contributors that you intend to contribute by posting a comment to the Github issue of your choice. Don't hesitate to ask questions if needed.
3. Make changes in your local copy of the code, run automated tests, commit, then [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/latechforce/engine/compare)
4. Wait for your PR to be reviewed and merged into the `main` branch of La Tech Force Engine's repository
5. Be available to reply if a contributor gets involved in the reviewing process of your PR.

## Acceptance criteria for Pull Requests (PR)

- A PR must address just one Github issue. Any PR that address zero or more than one Github issue (e.g. "cleaned .gitignore and added installation guide" are two independant PR) will be rejected.
- A PR must not break any functionality of the product. Every precaution (e.g. writing and running automated tests) must be taken to avoid that.

## Core principles

More generally, make sure to follow these three principles:

- Keep your PRs short
- Keep your PRs simple
- Avoid submitting PRs that may cause long discussions with the PR reviewer and/or other contributors

ðŸ¤— Beginners, you are welcome too! Don't be afraid, sending a PR is a great way to learn. You will probably be reassured by this article: [How To Win Friends And Make Pull Requests On GitHub](http://readwrite.com/2014/07/02/github-pull-request-etiquette/), and don't hesitate to ask for help.

## Code guidelines

- Optimize for search: [Like in the React.js project](https://facebook.github.io/react/contributing/design-principles.html), we want to make it easy for contributors to search for symbols (constants, variables and function names). So don't hesitate to give them verbose/specific names.

## Project Structure

- **src** Source code following the Clean Architecture patterns
- **test** Utilities for e2e tests

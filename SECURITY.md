## Reporting a Vulnerability

The La Tech Force Engine team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

If you discover a security vulnerability in the engine, please contact us at thomas.jeanneau@latechforce.com.

The La Tech Force Engine team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report you will be kept informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement.

Report security bugs in third-party dependencies to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).
